# üêæ Find a Pet API

A RESTful API developed in **Node.js** with **Fastify** for a pet adoption system, allowing organizations (ORGs) to register pets and users to find and adopt them.

This project was built with a focus on best development practices, utilizing **SOLID principles**, a **layered architecture** (use cases, controllers, repositories), **automated testing** (unit and e2e), and a **robust authentication and authorization system**.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Secure Authentication with JWT**  
  Implements short-lived access tokens and Refresh Tokens (stored in httpOnly cookies) for a secure and continuous session.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - **ADMIN**: Users with permission to manage critical entities, such as registering new organizations.  
  - **MEMBER**: Standard users with permission to search for and adopt pets.  

- **Org & Pet Management**  
  Organizations can manage their own pets, and administrators control the registration of new organizations.

- **Geospatial Search**  
  An endpoint to find nearby ORGs based on the user's latitude and longitude coordinates.

- **Dockerized Development Environment**  
  The PostgreSQL database is managed with Docker, ensuring a consistent and isolated development environment.

- **Data Validation with Zod**  
  Ensures that all data entering the application is valid and secure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Node.js  
- Fastify (Web Framework)  
- Prisma (ORM)  
- PostgreSQL (Database)  
- Docker  
- Vitest (Unit & E2E Testing)  
- Zod (Schema Validation)  
- TypeScript

## üèõÔ∏è Application Architecture

The application follows the principles of **clean architecture** and **SOLID**, separating responsibilities into distinct layers.

    end

    end

    subgraph Database
        K[(PostgreSQL - Docker)]
    end

    G -->|Instantiates & Injects| H
    G -->|Instantiates| I
    H -->|Uses| I
    I -->|Executes Query| J
    J --> K
```

**Flow Explanation (Example: POST /orgs)**

- A request arrives at the Fastify Server.

- The Router directs it to the corresponding controller, but first triggers the Middlewares.

- verifyJwt and verifyUserRole ensure the user is authenticated and has the ADMIN role.

- The Controller validates the body with Zod and calls the Factory.

- The Factory instantiates the Repository and injects it into the Use Case.

- The Use Case executes business logic and persists data via Prisma.

- Prisma communicates with PostgreSQL, and the response is returned to the client.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root by copying the example file.

```sh

cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file if necessary. The default settings are suitable for the Docker environment.
```

### 4. Start the Database with Docker
With Docker running, start the PostgreSQL database container:
```sh

docker-compose up -d
```
### 5. Run Prisma Migrations
This command will create the tables in your database according to the schema.

```sh

npx prisma migrate dev
```
### 6. Start the Application
```sh

npm run dev
Your API will now be running at http://localhost:3333.
```
---

## üß™ Running the Tests
The application has a complete test suite.

### Run unit tests
```sh

npm run test
```
### Run end-to-end (e2e) tests
(Requires the test database to be running in Docker)

```sh

npm run test:e2e
```
